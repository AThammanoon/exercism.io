### Add new LANGUAGE exercises

One of the easiest ways to add new exercises to the LANGUAGE track is to translate them from other language tracks on Exercism. This page lists all of the problem specifications in the common pool of exercises which have not yet been implemented in LANGUAGE.

The <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa fa-info-circle icon-red"></i> icon links to the language-independent description of the problem.

The <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa fa-list icon-red"></i> icon links to the canonical test data.

We also link to all the implementations of each exercise in other languages, which you can use for inspiration.

Once you've picked an exercise, follow the instructions in [this guide][porting-guide] and submit your pull request to the [LANGUAGE track repository](REPO) on GitHub.
