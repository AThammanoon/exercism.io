##### Help Us Improve the LANGUAGE Track!

Did you find a typo in the README? Is the test suite missing an edge case?
We want to know about it.

We always welcome GitHub issues and pull requests. See the
[LANGUAGE](REPO) repository for more information.

If you are new to open source, or are looking for an easy way in, 
feel free to check out the [good first patch](REPO/labels/good%20first%20patch) issues.

#### Help Add More LANGUAGE Exercises

The easiest way to add new exercises is to translate existing exercises from other language tracks on Exercism.
Here's the [full list of unimplemented exercises in LANGUAGE](/languages/TRACK_ID/todo)
along with links to all the existing implementations.

If you have an idea for a completely new exercise, you can follow [this guide][new-exercise-guide] to add it to the site.
