When you're logged in, you can say `exercism fetch TRACK_ID` to get the next available exercise on the track.

Every time you submit a solution to an exercise, you will get the next in line the next time you fetch.

If you want to try a specific exercise, you can always fetch it directly (commands are listed below).

The exercises are ordered roughly in order of difficulty.
